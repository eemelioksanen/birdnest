This is a web application made for the reaktor 2023 summer developer trainee pre-assignment: https://www.reaktor.com/careers/developer-trainee-summer-2023-6514340002/

## How to run the application
### 1. Install dependencies
You can either run `npm install` in both client and server folders, or just use `npm install` in the root folder.

### 2. Build the client
You can run `npm run build` in either the `root` or the `client` folder.

### 3. Set the PORT environmental variable
The application by defaul runs on the port `3000`. To change this create a `.env`-file to the root of the `server` folder and set the contents to: <br>
`PORT=port_number`

### 4. Start the application
This can also be done by running `npm start` in either `root` or `server` folders.
